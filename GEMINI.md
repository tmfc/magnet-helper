# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This project, "magnet-helper," is a tool designed to automatically download magnet links to a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. It appears to be a Node.js project, based on the presence of `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. The primary goal is to streamline the process of downloading content directly to a NAS without manual intervention.

## Building and Running

**NOTE:** The `package.json` file is currently empty, so the following commands are placeholders. You will need to define the `start` script and any other necessary scripts in your `package.json`.

### Installation

To install the project dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, you would typically use a command defined in the `scripts` section of your `package.json`. For example:

```bash
npm start
```

### Testing

To run tests, you would use a command like:

```bash
npm test
```

**TODO:** Populate the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file with the appropriate commands to run the application and any tests. You also need to add dependencies to the `package.json` file.

## Development Conventions

Since this is a Node.js project, it is recommended to follow these conventions:

*   **Code Style:** Use a consistent code style. Consider using a tool like Prettier or ESLint to enforce a consistent style.
*   **Testing:** Write unit tests for your code. A popular testing framework for Node.js is Jest.
*   **Dependency Management:** Use npm or yarn to manage your project's dependencies.
*   **Contribution Guidelines:** If this is an open-source project, create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to explain how others can contribute.
